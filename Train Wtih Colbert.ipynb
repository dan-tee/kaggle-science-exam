Under the dark matter hypothesis, objects formed from baryonic material ejected during the merger or tidal interaction of two galaxies (&quot;dwarf galaxy&quot;) are expected to be devoid of dark matter and hence show no mass discrepancy. Three objects unambiguously identified as Tidal Dwarf Galaxies appear to have mass discrepancies in close agreement with the MOND prediction. Recent work has shown that many of the dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way and Andromeda are located preferentially in a single plane and have correlated motions. This suggests that they may have formed during a close encounter with another galaxy and hence be Tidal Dwarf Galaxies. If so, the presence of mass discrepancies in these systems constitutes further evidence for MOND. In addition, it has been claimed that a gravitational force stronger than Newton&#x27;s (such as Milgrom&#x27;s) is required for these galaxies to retain their orbits over time. In 2020, a group of astronomers analyzing data from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) sample together with estimates of the large-scale external gravitational field from an all-sky galaxy catalog, concluded that there was highly statistically significant evidence of violations of the strong equivalence principle in weak gravitational fields in the vicinity of rotationally supported galaxies. They observed an effect consistent with the external field effect of Modified Newtonian dynamics and inconsistent with tidal effects in the Lambda-CDM model paradigm commonly known as the Standard Model of Cosmology. In a 2022 published survey of dwarf galaxies from the Fornax Deep Survey (FDS) catalogue, a group of astronomers and physicists conclude that…</td><td>&quot;proximity to the Solar System and other planetary systems, MOND successfully explains significant observed galactic-scale rotational effects without invoking the existence of as-yet undetected dark matter particles lying outside of the highly successful Standard Model of particle physics. This is in large part due to MOND holding that exceedingly weak galactic-scale gravity holding galaxies together near their perimeters declines as a very slow linear relationship to distance from the center of a galaxy rather than declining as the inverse square of distance. Milgrom&#x27;s law can be interpreted in two ways: One possibility is to treat it as a modification to Newton&#x27;s second law, so that the force on an object is not proportional to the particle&#x27;s acceleration mvara but rather to muleft( fracaa_0 right) a. In this case, the modified dynamics would apply not only to gravitational phenomena, but also those generated by other forces, for example electromagnetism. Alternatively, Milgrom&#x27;s law can be viewed as leaving Newton&#x27;s Second Law intact and instead modifying the inverse-square law of gravity, so that the true gravitational force on an object of mass mvarm due to another of mass mvarM is roughly of the form fracG M mmuleft( fracaa_0 right) r2. In this interpretation, Milgrom&#x27;s modification would apply exclusively to gravitational phenomena. By itself, Milgrom&#x27;s law is not a complete and self-contained physical theory, but rather an ad hoc empirically motivated variant of one of the several equations that constitute classical mechanics. Its status within a coherent non-relativistic hypothesis of MOND is akin to Kepler&#x27;s Third Law within Newtonian mechanics; it provides a succinct description of observational facts, but must itself be explained by more fundamental concepts situated within the underlying hypothesis. Several complete classical hypotheses have been proposed (typically along &quot;modified gravity&quot; as opposed to &quot;modified inertia&quot; lines), which generally yield …</td><td>&quot;Newtonian analysis, and there is no requirement that the missing mass be non-baryonic. It has been speculated that 2 eV neutrinos could account for the cluster observations in MOND while preserving the hypothesis&#x27;s successes at the galaxy scale. Indeed, analysis of sharp lensing data for the galaxy cluster Abell 1689 shows that MOND only becomes distinctive at Mpc distance from the center, so that Zwicky&#x27;s conundrum remains, and 1.8 eV neutrinos&quot;</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;Which of the following is an accurate definition of dynamic scaling in self-similar systems?&quot;</td><td>&quot;Dynamic scaling refers to the evolution of self-similar systems, where data obtained from snapshots at fixed times exhibits similarity to the respective data taken from snapshots of any earlier or later time.

Knowledge of trigonometric functions and methods reached Western Europe via Latin translations of the 12th century of Ptolemy&#x27;s Greek Almagest as well as the works of Astronomy in medieval Islam such as Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī and Nasir al-Din al-Tusi.sfnpBoyer1991pp237, 274 One of the earliest works on trigonometry by a northern European mathematician is De Triangulis by the 15th century German mathematician Regiomontanus, who was encouraged to write, and provided with a copy of the Almagest, by the Byzantine scholars in Renaissance cardinal Basilios Bessarion with whom he lived for several years. At the same time, another translation of the Almagest from Greek into Latin was completed by the Cretan George of Trebizond. Trigonometry was still so little known in 16th-century northern Europe that Nicolaus Copernicus devoted two chapters of De revolutionibus orbium coelestium to explain its basic concepts. Driven by the demands of navigation and the growing need for accurate maps of large geographic areas, trigonometry grew into a major branch of mathematics. Bartholomaeus Pitiscus was the first to use the word, publishing his Trigonometria in 1595. Gemma Frisius described for the first time the method of triangulation still used today in surveying. It was Leonhard Euler who fully incorporated complex numbers into trigonometry. The works of the Scottish mathematicians James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician) in the 17th century and Colin Maclaurin in the 18th century were influential in the development of trigonometric series. Also in the 18th century, Brook Taylor defined the general Taylor series.&quot;</td><td>&quot;In 1810, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe published his comprehensive Theory of Colours in which he provided a rational description of color experience, which &#x27;tells us how it originates, not what it is&#x27;.

So the available regularization methods are understood as formalistic technical devices, devoid of any direct physical meaning.

Significance In summary, the invention of the rhomb was not a single event in Fresnel&#x27;s career, but a process spanning a large part of it. Arguably, the calculation of the phase shift on total internal reflection marked not only the completion of his theory of the rhomb, but also the essential completion of his reconstruction of physical optics on the transverse-wave hypothesis (see Augustin-Jean Fresnel). The calculation of the phase shift was also a landmark in the application of complex numbers.
