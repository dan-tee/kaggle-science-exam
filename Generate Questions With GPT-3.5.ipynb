In 1900, German physicist Max Planck heuristically derived a formula for the observed spectrum by assuming that a hypothetical electrically charged oscillator in a cavity that contained black-body radiation could only change its energy in a minimal increment, mvarE, that was proportional to the frequency of its associated electromagnetic wave. While Planck originally regarded the hypothesis of dividing energy into increments as a mathematical artifice, introduced merely to get the correct answer, other physicists including Albert Einstein built on his work, and Planck&#x27;s insight is now recognized to be of fundamental importance to quantum theory.&quot;</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;Representation up to homotopy&quot;</td><td>&quot;Examples&quot;</td><td>1532</td><td>&quot;Examples are usual representations of Lie algebroids or more specifically Lie algebras, i.e. modules.\n",

In 1965, Dennis Lindley&#x27;s two-volume work titled &quot;Introduction to Probability and Statistics from a Bayesian Viewpoint&quot; played a vital role in introducing Bayesian methods to a wide audience.

ACE is a metric of the total energy a system has exerted over its lifespan. ACE is calculated by summing the squares of a cyclone&#x27;s sustained wind speed, every six hours as long as the system is at or above tropical storm intensity and either tropical or subtropical. The calculation of the PDI is similar in nature to ACE, with the major difference being that wind speeds are cubed rather than squared. The Hurricane Surge Index is a metric of the potential damage a storm may inflict via storm surge. It is calculated by squaring the dividend of the storm&#x27;s wind speed and a climatological value (cvt33m/smphdispor), and then multiplying that quantity by the dividend of the radius of hurricane-force winds and its climatological value (cvt96.6kmmidispor).

This glass substrate, apart from providing a support that the oxide can grow on, has the additional benefit of blocking most infrared wavelengths greater than 2μm for most silicates, and converting it to heat in the glass layer. This in turn helps maintain a low temperature of the active region of the solar cell, which degrades in performance as it heats up. TCO films can be deposited on a substrate through various deposition methods, including metal organic chemical vapor deposition, metal organic molecular beam deposition, solution deposition, spray pyrolysis, ultrasonic nozzle sprayed graphene oxide and air sprayed Ag Nanowire  and pulsed laser deposition (PLD), however conventional fabrication techniques typically involve magnetron sputtering of the film. The sputtering process is very inefficient, with only 30% of planar target material available for deposition on the substrate. Cylindrical targets offer closer to 80% utilization. In the case of ITO recycling of unused target material is required for economic production. For AZO or ZnAl sputtering target material is sufficiently inexpensive that recovery of materials use is of no concern. There is some concern that there is a physical limit to the available indium for ITO. Growth typically is performed in a reducing environment to compensating acceptor defects within the film (e.g. metal vacancies), which degrade the carrier concentration (if n-type).\n",

       "For AZO thin film deposition, the coating method of reactive magnetron sputtering is very economical and practical way of mass production. In this method, a zinc-aluminum metal target is sputtered in an oxygen atmosphere such that metal ions oxidize when they reach the substrates surface. By using a metal target instead of an oxide target, direct current magnetron sputtering may be used which enable much faster deposition rates.&quot;</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;Antibody&quot;</td><td>&quot;Fc region&quot;</td><td>1095</td><td>&quot;mainFragment crystallizable region\n",
