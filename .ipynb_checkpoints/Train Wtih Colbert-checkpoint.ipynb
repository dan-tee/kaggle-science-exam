It is a mathematical description of a Randomness phenomenon in terms of its sample space and the Probability of Event (probability theory) (subsets of the sample space).&quot;</td><td>&quot;Before a particular measurement in quantum mechanics is performed on a quantum system, the theory gives only a probability distribution for the outcome, and the form that this distribution takes is completely determined by the quantum state and the linear operators describing the measurement. Probability distributions for different measurements exhibit tradeoffs exemplified by the uncertainty principle: a state that implies a narrow spread of possible outcomes for one experiment necessarily implies a wide spread of possible outcomes for another. Statistical mixtures of states are a different type of linear combination.&quot;</td><td>&quot;In general, a binomial distribution applies when an experiment is repeated a fixed number of times, each trial of the experiment has two possible outcomes (success and failure), the probability of success is the same for each trial, and the trials are statistically independent. Because the binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution (i.e., not continuous) and difficult to calculate for large numbers of trials, a variety of approximations are used to calculate this confidence interval, all with their own tradeoffs in accuracy and computational intensity.&quot;</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;What is quantum biology?&quot;</td><td>&quot;Quantum biology&quot;</td><td>&quot;Ferritin&quot;</td><td>&quot;Quantum biology is the study of ferritin, an iron storage protein found in plants and animals, and its quantum mechanical properties.&quot;</td><td>&quot;Quantum biology is the study of the influence of non-trivial quantum phenomena on biological processes, which can be explained by reducing them to fundamental physics.&quot;</td><td>&quot;Quantum biology is the study of electron tunneling through ferritin in biological systems, which is a quantum biological process.&quot;</td><td>&quot;Quantum biology is the study of applications of quantum mechanics and theoretical chemistry to aspects of biology that cannot be accurately described by the classical laws of physics.&quot;</td><td>&quot;Quantum biology is the study of biological processes that involve the conversion of energy into usable forms for chemical transformations, such as photosynthesis and cellular respiration.&quot;</td><td>&quot;D&quot;</td><td>162360</td><td>162362</td><td>162361</td><td>&quot;Quantum biology is the study of applications of quantum mechanics and theoretical chemistry to aspects of biology that cannot be accurately described by the classical laws of physics.

LFTR designs use a strong Temperature coefficient#Temperature coefficient of reactivity to achieve passive inherent safety against excursions of reactivity. The temperature dependence comes from 3 sources. The first is that thorium absorbs more neutrons if it overheats, the so-called Doppler effect. This leaves fewer neutrons to continue the chain reaction, reducing power. The second part is heating the graphite moderator, that usually causes a positive contribution to the temperature coefficient.&quot;</td><td>&quot;MSRs offer many potential advantages over light water reactors: Passive decay heat removal is achieved in MSRs. In some designs, the fuel and the coolant are a single fluid, so a loss of coolant carries the fuel with it. Fluoride salts dissolve poorly in water, and do not form burnable hydrogen. The molten salt coolant is not damaged by neutron bombardment, though the reactor vessel is. A low-pressure MSR does not require an expensive, steel core containment vessel, piping, and safety equipment. However, most MSR designs place radioactive fluid in direct contact with pumps and heat exchangers.&quot;</td><td>&quot;MSRs, especially those with fuel in the molten salt, offer lower operating pressures, and higher temperatures. In this respect an MSR is more similar to a liquid metal cooled reactor than to a conventional light water cooled reactor. MSR designs are often breeding reactors with a closed fuel cycle—as opposed to the once-through fuel currently used in conventional nuclear power generators. MSRs exploit a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity and a large allowable temperature rise to prevent Criticality accident. For designs with the fuel in the salt, the salt thermally expands immediately with power excursions.&quot;</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;What is the scalar measure of the angular displacement per unit time in physics?&quot;</td><td>&quot;Angular frequency&quot;</td><td>&quot;References and notes&quot;</td><td>&quot;Angular rate&quot;</td><td>&quot;Angular frequency&quot;</td><td>&quot;Angular speed&quot;</td><td>&quot;Angular displacement&quot;</td><td>&quot;Angular velocity&quot;</td><td>&quot;B&quot;</td><td>7140</td><td>175457</td><td>175462</td><td>&quot;File:AngularFrequency.gif File:Rotating Sphere.gif In physics, angular frequency &quot;ω&quot; (also referred to by the terms angular speed and angular rate) is a Scalar (physics) measure of the angular displacement per unit time (for example, in rotation) or the rate of change of the phase of a sinusoidal waveform (for example, in oscillations and waves), or as the rate of change of the argument of the sine function.

While in classical distribution theory a general multiplication of distributions is not possible, Colombeau algebras provide a rigorous framework for this.

Schwartz&#x27; impossibility result, which basically states that there cannot be a differential algebra containing the space of distributions and preserving the product of continuous functions.&quot;</td><td>&quot;However, if one only wants to preserve the product of smooth functions instead such a construction becomes possible, as demonstrated first by Colombeau. As a mathematical tool, Colombeau algebras can be said to combine a treatment of singularities, differentiation and nonlinear operations in one framework, lifting the limitations of distribution theory. These algebras have found numerous applications in the fields of partial differential equations, geophysics, microlocal analysis and general relativity so far.

Colombeau algebras are constructed to satisfy conditions 1.–3. and a condition like 4., but with C(mathbbR) times C(mathbbR) replaced by Cinfty(mathbbR) times Cinfty(mathbbR), i.e., they preserve the product of smooth (infinitely differentiable) functions only.&quot;</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;Which of the following statements accurately describes money laundering?&quot;</td><td>&quot;Money&quot;</td><td>&quot;Financial crimes&quot;</td><td>&quot;Money laundering is the process in which the proceeds of crime are transformed into ostensibly legitimate money or other assets.

Therefore, if the diffracting object is smaller, the resulting diffraction pattern will be slightly narrower.&quot;</td><td>&quot;D&quot;</td><td>&quot;File:Diffraction on elliptic aperture with fft.png Several qualitative observations can be made of diffraction in general: The angular spacing of the features in the diffraction pattern is inversely proportional to the dimensions of the object causing the diffraction. In other words: The smaller the diffracting object, the &#x27;wider&#x27; the resulting diffraction pattern, and vice versa. (More precisely, this is true of the sines of the angles.) The diffraction angles are invariant under scaling; that is, they depend only on the ratio of the wavelength to the size of the diffracting object.&quot;</td><td>&quot;Image:Angular-size-redshift-relation.png File:Distanza di diametro angolare.png The angular size redshift relation describes the relation between the angular size observed on the sky of an object of given physical size, and the object&#x27;s redshift from Earth (which is related to its distance, d , from Earth). In a Euclidean geometry the relation between size on the sky and distance from Earth would simply be given by the equation: where theta is the angular size of the object on the sky, x is the size of the object and d is the distance to the object.&quot;</td><td>&quot;The dimensions of the central band are related to the dimensions of the slit by the same relationship as for a single slit so that the larger dimension in the diffracted image corresponds to the smaller dimension in the slit. The spacing of the fringes is also inversely proportional to the slit dimension. If the illuminating beam does not illuminate the whole vertical length of the slit, the spacing of the vertical fringes is determined by the dimensions of the illuminating beam.&quot;</td><td>&quot;D A C&quot;</td><td>&quot;D&quot;</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;Which of the following statements accurately depicts the relationship between Gauss&#x27;s law, electric flux, electric field, and symmetry in electric fields?&quot;</td><td>&quot;Gauss&#x27;s law holds only for situations involving symmetric electric fields, like those with spherical or cylindrical symmetry, and doesn&#x27;t apply to other field types. Electric flux, as an expression of the total electric field passing through a closed surface, is influenced only by charges within the surface and unaffected by distant charges located outside it. The scalar quantity electric flux is strictly measured in SI fundamental quantities as kg·m3·s−3·A.&quot;</td><td>&quot;Gauss&#x27;s law holds in all cases, but it is most useful for calculations involving symmetric electric fields, like those with spherical or cylindrical symmetry, as they allow for simpler algebraic manipulations. Electric flux is not affected by distant charges outside the closed surface, whereas the net electric field, E, can be influenced by any charges positioned outside of the closed surface. In SI base units, the electric flux is expressed as kg·m3·s−3·A−1.&quot;</td><td>&quot;Gauss&#x27;s law, which applies equally to all electric fields, is typically most useful when dealing with symmetric field configurations, like those with spherical or cylindrical symmetry, since it makes it easier to calculate the total electric flux. Electric flux, an expression of the total electric field through a closed surface, is unaffected by charges outside the surface, while net electric field, E, may be influenced by charges located outside the closed surface. Electric flux is expressed in SI base units as kg·m3·s−1·C.&quot;</td><td>&quot;Gauss&#x27;s law only holds for electric fields with cylindrical symmetry, like those of a straight long wire; it is not applicable to fields with other types of symmetry. Electric flux, which measures the total electric field across a closed surface, is influenced by all charges within the surface as well as by those located outside it. The unit of electric flux in SI base units is kg·m2·s−2·A−1.&quot;</td><td>&quot;Gauss&#x27;s law, which holds for all situations, is most beneficial when applied to electric fields that exhibit higher degrees of symmetry, like those with cylindrical and spherical symmetry. While electric flux is unaffected by charges outside of a given closed surface, the net electric field, E, may be affected by them.

The coefficient of the proportion is the vacuum permittivity.&quot;</td><td>&quot;Gauss&#x27;s law MainGauss&#x27;s law File:VFPt charges plus minus thumb.svg Gauss&#x27;s law describes the relationship between a static electric field and electric charges: a static electric field points away from positive charges and towards negative charges, and the net electric flux of the electric field through a Gaussian surface is proportional to the enclosed charge, including bound charge due to polarization of material. The coefficient of the proportion is the vacuum permittivity.&quot;</td><td>&quot;In its integral form, it states that the flux of the electric field out of an arbitrary closed surface is proportional to the electric charge enclosed by the surface, irrespective of how that charge is distributed. Even though the law alone is insufficient to determine the electric field across a surface enclosing any charge distribution, this may be possible in cases where symmetry mandates uniformity of the field. Where no such symmetry exists, Gauss&#x27;s law can be used in its differential form, which states that the divergence of the electric field is proportional to the local density of charge.&quot;</td><td>&quot;A B D&quot;</td><td>&quot;A&quot;</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;Which of the following statements accurately describes the dimension of an object in a CW complex?&quot;</td><td>&quot;The dimension of an object in a CW complex is the largest n for which the n-skeleton is nontrivial, where the empty set is considered to have dimension -1 and the boundary of a discrete set of points is the empty set.&quot;</td><td>&quot;The dimension of an object in a CW complex is determined by the number of critical points the object contains.

The blocking temperature is typically higher than the Néel temperature.&quot;</td><td>&quot;The blocking temperature of an antiferromagnetic layer in a spin valve is the temperature below which the layer loses its ability to &quot;pin&quot; the magnetization direction of an adjacent ferromagnetic layer. The blocking temperature is typically higher than the Néel temperature.&quot;</td><td>&quot;The blocking temperature of an antiferromagnetic layer in a spin valve is the temperature at which the ferromagnetic layer becomes completely demagnetized. The blocking temperature is typically higher than the Néel temperature.&quot;</td><td>&quot;The blocking temperature of an antiferromagnetic layer in a spin valve is the temperature at or above which the layer ceases to prevent the orientation of an adjacent ferromagnetic layer. The blocking temperature is typically lower than the Néel temperature.&quot;</td><td>&quot;The blocking temperature of an antiferromagnetic layer in a spin valve is the temperature at which the ferromagnetic layer loses its ability to &quot;pin&quot; the magnetization direction of an adjacent antiferromagnetic layer. The blocking temperature is typically higher than the Néel temperature.&quot;</td><td>&quot;D&quot;</td><td>&quot;In the most successful spin valves the GMR effect originates from exchange bias. They comprise a sensitive layer, &quot;fixed&quot; layer and an antiferromagnetic layer. The last layer freezes the magnetization direction in the &quot;fixed&quot; layer. The sensitive and antiferromagnetic layers are made thin to reduce the resistance of the structure. The valve reacts to the external magnetic field by changing the magnetization direction in the sensitive layer relatively to the &quot;fixed&quot; layer.&quot;</td><td>&quot;FeMn or NiMn can be used for the antiferromagnetic layer. The fixed layer is made of a magnetic material such as cobalt. Such a sensor has an asymmetric hysteresis loop owing to the presence of the magnetically hard, fixed layer. Spin valves may exhibit anisotropic magnetoresistance, which leads to an asymmetry in the sensitivity curve.&quot;</td><td>&quot;In the simplest case, a spin valve consists of a non-magnetic material sandwiched between two ferromagnetism, one of which is fixed (pinned) by an antiferromagnetism which acts to raise its magnetic coercivity and behaves as a &quot;hard&quot; layer, while the other is free (unpinned) and behaves as a &quot;soft&quot; layer. Due to the difference in coercivity, the soft layer changes polarity at lower applied magnetic field strength than the hard one. Upon application of a magnetic field of appropriate strength, the soft layer switches polarity, producing two distinct states: a parallel, low-resistance state, and an antiparallel, high-resistance state.&quot;</td><td>&quot;B E A&quot;</td><td>&quot;B&quot;</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"
