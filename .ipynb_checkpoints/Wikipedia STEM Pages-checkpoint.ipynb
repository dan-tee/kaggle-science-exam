    "\n",
    "The dataset for the competition was generated by **providing snippets of text on various scientific topics to the gpt3.5 model and asking it to write multiple choice questions (with known answers). Easy questions were filtered out.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest models currently run on Kaggle have around 10 billion parameters, while gpt3.5 has 175 billion parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The competition aims to explore whether a question-answering model more than 10 times smaller than gpt3.5 can effectively answer questions written by gpt3.5. The results will shed light on the benchmarking and self-testing capabilities of LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Desscription\n",
    "Your challenge in this competition is to answer multiple-choice questions written by an LLM. While the specifics of the process used to generate these questions aren't public, we've included 200 sample questions with answers to show the format, and to give a general sense of the kind of questions in the test set. However, there may be a distributional shift between the sample questions and the test set, so solutions that generalize to a broad set of questions are likely to perform better. Each question consists of a prompt (the question), 5 options labeled A, B, C, D, and E, and the correct answer labeled answer (this holds the label of the most correct answer, as defined by the generating LLM).\n",
    "\n",
    "This competition uses a hidden test. When your submitted notebook is scored, the actual test data (including a sample submission) will be made available to your notebook. The test set has the same format as the provided test.csv but has ~4000 questions that may be different is subject matter."

They play the role of a [[order parameter|disorder parameter]] for the [[Higgs phase]] in pure [[gauge theory]]. Consistency conditions between [[electric charge|electric]] and magnetic charges limit the possible 't Hooft loops that can be used, similarly to the way that the [[Dirac quantization condition]] limits the set of allowed [[magnetic monopole|magnetic monopoles]]. They were first introduced by [[Gerard 't Hooft]] in 1978 in the context of possible [[phase (matter)|phases]] that gauge theories admit.<ref>{{cite journal|last1='t Hooft|first1=G.|authorlink1=Gerard 't Hooft|date=1978|title=On the phase transition towards permanent quark confinement|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0550-3213%2878%2990153-0|journal=Nuclear Physics B|volume=138|issue=1|pages=1–25|doi=10.1016/0550-3213(78)90153-0|pmid=|arxiv=|bibcode=1978NuPhB.138....1T |s2cid=|access-date=}}</ref>\\n\\n== Definition ==\\n\\nThere are a number of ways to define 't Hooft lines and loops.

't Hooft lines can also be inserted in the [[path integral formulation|path integal]] by requiring that the gauge field measure can only run over configurations whose magnetic field takes the above form.\\n\\nMore generally, the 't Hooft loop can be defined as the [[operator (physics)|operator]] whose effect is equivalent to performing a modified gauge transformations <math>\\\\Omega</math> that is singular on the loop <math>C</math> in such a way that any other loop <math>C'</math> parametrized by <math>s \\\\in [0,1]</math> with a [[winding number]] <math>l</math> around <math>C</math> satisfies<ref>{{cite book|last=Năstase|first=H.|author-link=Horațiu Năstase|date=2019|title=Introduction to Quantum Field Theory|url=|doi=|location=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|chapter=50|pages=472–474|isbn=978-1108493994}}</ref>\\n\\n:<math>\\n\\\\Omega(s=1) = e^{i2\\\\pi l/N}\\\\Omega(s=0).\\n</math>\\n\\nThese modified gauge transformations are not true gauge transformations as they do not leave the [[action (physics)|action]] invariant. For temporal loops they create the aforementioned field configurations while for spatial loops they instead create loops of color magnetic flux, referred to as [[center vortex|center vortices]]. By constructing such gauge transformations, an explicit form for the 't Hooft loop can be derived by introducing the Yang–Mills [[Hamiltonian mechanics|conjugate momentum operator]]\\n\\n:<math>\\n\\\\Pi^a_i(x) = -i \\\\frac{\\\\delta}{\\\\delta A^a_i(x)}.\\n</math>\\n\\nIf the loop <math>C</math> encloses a surface <math>\\\\Sigma</math>, then an explicitly form of the 't Hooft loop operator is<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Reinhardt|first1=H.|authorlink1=|date=2002|title=On 't Hooft's loop operator|url=|journal=Phys.

The four phases are\\n* Confinement: Wilson loops follow the area law while 't Hooft loops follow the perimeter law.\\n* Higgs phase: Wilson loops follow the perimeter law while 't Hooft loops follow the area law.\\n* Confinement together with a partially Higgsed phase: both follow the area law.\\n* Mixed phase: both follow the perimeter law.\\nIn the third phase the gauge group is only partially broken down to a smaller [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]] [[subgroup]]. The mixed phase requires the [[gauge boson|gauge bosons]] to be [[massless particle|massless particles]] and does not occur for <math>\\\\text{SU}(N)</math> theories, but is similar to the phase for [[abelian group|abelian]] theory is the Coulomb phase.\\n\\nSince 't Hooft operators are creation operators for center vortices, they play an important role in the center vortex scenario for confinement.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Englehardt|first1=M.|authorlink1=|display-authors=etal|date=1998|title=Interaction of confining vortices in SU(2) lattice gauge theory|url=|journal=Phys.

This can be formulated more precisely by introducing the [[weight (representation theory)|weights]] <math>\\\\boldsymbol \\\\mu</math> of the Lie algebra, which span the weight lattice <math>\\\\Lambda_w(\\\\mathfrak g)</math>. Denoting <math>\\\\Lambda^G_w \\\\subset \\\\Lambda_w</math> as the lattice spanned by the weights associated with the algebra of <math>G</math> rather than <math>\\\\mathfrak g</math>, the Wilson lines are in one-to-one correspondence with the lattice points <math>\\\\Lambda_w^G/W</math> lattice where <math>W</math> is the Weyl group.\\n\\nThe Lie algebra valued charge of the 't Hooft line can always be written in terms of the rank <math>r</math> Cartan subalgebra <math>\\\\boldsymbol H</math> as <math>Q=\\\\boldsymbol m \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol H</math>, where <math>\\\\boldsymbol m</math> is an <math>r</math>-dimensional charge vector. Due to Wilson lines, the 't Hooft charge must satisfy the generalized Dirac quantization condition <math>e^{i\\\\boldsymbol m \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol H} = 1</math>, which must hold for all representations of the Lie algebra.\\n\\nThe generalized quantization condition is equivalent to the demand that <math>\\\\boldsymbol m \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mu \\\\in 2\\\\pi \\\\mathbb Z</math> holds for all weight vectors. To get the set of vectors <math>\\\\boldsymbol m</math> that satisfy this condition, one must consider [[root system|roots]] <math>\\\\boldsymbol \\\\alpha</math> which are [[adjoint representation]] weight vectors. Co-roots, defined using roots by <math>\\\\boldsymbol \\\\alpha^\\\\vee = 2\\\\boldsymbol \\\\alpha/\\\\boldsymbol \\\\alpha^2</math>, span the co-root lattice <math>\\\\Lambda_{\\\\text{co-root}}(\\\\mathfrak g)</math>. These vectors have the useful property that <math>\\\\boldsymbol \\\\alpha^\\\\vee \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mu \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z</math> meaning that the only magnetic charges allowed for the 't Hooft lines are ones that are in the co-root lattice\\n\\n:<math>\\n\\\\boldsymbol m \\\\in 2\\\\pi \\\\Lambda_{\\\\text{co-root}}(\\\\mathfrak g).\\n</math>\\n\\nThis is sometimes written in terms of the [[Langlands dual group|Langlands dual algebra]] <math>\\\\mathfrak g^\\\\vee</math> of <math>\\\\mathfrak g</math> with a weight lattice <math>\\\\Lambda_{mw}</math>, in which case the 't Hooft lines are described by <math>\\\\Lambda_{mw}/W</math>.\\n\\nMore general classes of [[dyon|dyonic]] line operators, with both electric and magnetic charges, can also be constructed. Sometimes called Wilson–'t Hooft line operators, they are defined by pairs of charges <math>(\\\\lambda_e, \\\\lambda_m) \\\\in \\\\Lambda_w \\\\times \\\\Lambda_{mw}</math> up to the [[equivalence class|identification]] that for all <math>w \\\\in W</math> it holds that\\n\\n:<math>\\n(\\\\lambda_e, \\\\lambda_m) \\\\sim (w\\\\lambda_e, w \\\\lambda_m).\\n</math>\\n\\nLine operators play a role in indicating differences in gauge theories of the form <math>G = \\\\tilde G/H</math> that differ by the center subgroup <math>H</math>. Unless they are [[compactification (physics)|compactified]], these theories do not differ in local physics and no amount of local [[experiment|experiments]] can deduce the exact gauge group of the theory. Despite this, the theories do differ in their global properties, such as having different sets of allowed line operators. For example, in <math>\\\\text{SU}(N)</math> gauge theories, Wilson loops are labelled by <math>\\\\Lambda_w(\\\\mathfrak g)</math> while 't Hooft lines by <math>\\\\Lambda_{\\\\text{co-root}}(\\\\mathfrak g)</math>. However in <math>\\\\text{SU}(N)/\\\\mathbb Z_N</math> the lattices are reversed where now the Wilson lines are determined by <math>\\\\Lambda_{\\\\text{co-root}}</math> while the 't Hooft lines are determined by <math>\\\\Lambda_w</math>.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kapustin|first1=A.|authorlink1=Anton Kapustin|date=2006|title=Wilson-'t Hooft operators in four-dimensional gauge theories and S-duality|url=|journal=Phys.

       "\"\\n\\nIn quantum field theory, the 't Hooft loop is a magnetic analogue of the Wilson loop for which spatial loops give rise to thin loops of magnetic flux associated with magnetic vortices. They play the role of a disorder parameter for the Higgs phase in pure gauge theory. Consistency conditions between electric and magnetic charges limit the possible 't Hooft loops that can be used, similarly to the way that the Dirac quantization condition limits the set of allowed magnetic monopoles. They were first introduced by Gerard 't Hooft in 1978 in the context of possible phases that gauge theories admit.\\n\\n== Definition ==\\n\\nThere are a number of ways to define 't Hooft lines and loops. For [[causal structure|timelike]] curves <math>C</math> they are equivalent to the gauge configuration arising from the [[world line|worldline]] traced out by a magnetic monopole.<ref>{{citation|last=Tong|first=D.|author-link=David Tong (physicist)|title=Lecture Notes on Gauge Theory|chapter=2|pages=89–90|date=2018|chapter-url=https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/gaugetheory.html}}</ref> These are [[singularity (mathematics)|singular]] gauge field configurations on the line such that their spatial slice have a [[magnetic field]] whose form approaches that of a magnetic monopole\\n\\n:<math>\\nB^i \\\\xrightarrow{r\\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\frac{x^i}{4\\\\pi r^3}Q(x),\\n</math>\\n\\nwhere in [[Yang–Mills theory]] <math>Q(x)</math> is the generally [[Lie algebra]] valued object specifying the magnetic charge. 't Hooft lines can also be inserted in the [[path integral formulation|path integal]] by requiring that the gauge field measure can only run over configurations whose magnetic field takes the above form.\\n\\nMore generally, the 't Hooft loop can be defined as the [[operator (physics)|operator]] whose effect is equivalent to performing a modified gauge transformations <math>\\\\Omega</math> that is singular on the loop <math>C</math> in such a way that any other loop <math>C'</math> parametrized by <math>s \\\\in [0,1]</math> with a [[winding number]] <math>l</math> around <math>C</math> satisfies<ref>{{cite book|last=Năstase|first=H.|author-link=Horațiu Năstase|date=2019|title=Introduction to Quantum Field Theory|url=|doi=|location=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|chapter=50|pages=472–474|isbn=978-1108493994}}</ref>\\n\\n:<math>\\n\\\\Omega(s=1) = e^{i2\\\\pi l/N}\\\\Omega(s=0).\\n</math>\\n\\nThese modified gauge transformations are not true gauge transformations as they do not leave the [[action (physics)|action]] invariant.

The commutation properties between these two loop operators is often utilized in [[topological quantum field theory|topological field theory]] where these operators form an [[algebra over a field|algebra]].\\n\\n== Disorder operator == \\nThe 't Hooft loop is a disorder operator since it creates singularities in the gauge field, with their [[vacuum expectation value|expectation value]] distinguishing the disordered phase of pure Yang–Mills theory from the ordered [[color confinement|confining phase]].

This can be formulated more precisely by introducing the [[weight (representation theory)|weights]] <math>\\\\boldsymbol \\\\mu</math> of the Lie algebra, which span the weight lattice <math>\\\\Lambda_w(\\\\mathfrak g)</math>. Denoting <math>\\\\Lambda^G_w \\\\subset \\\\Lambda_w</math> as the lattice spanned by the weights associated with the algebra of <math>G</math> rather than <math>\\\\mathfrak g</math>, the Wilson lines are in one-to-one correspondence with the lattice points <math>\\\\Lambda_w^G/W</math> lattice where <math>W</math> is the Weyl group.\\n\\nThe Lie algebra valued charge of the 't Hooft line can always be written in terms of the rank <math>r</math> Cartan subalgebra <math>\\\\boldsymbol H</math> as <math>Q=\\\\boldsymbol m \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol H</math>, where <math>\\\\boldsymbol m</math> is an <math>r</math>-dimensional charge vector. Due to Wilson lines, the 't Hooft charge must satisfy the generalized Dirac quantization condition <math>e^{i\\\\boldsymbol m \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol H} = 1</math>, which must hold for all representations of the Lie algebra.\\n\\nThe generalized quantization condition is equivalent to the demand that <math>\\\\boldsymbol m \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mu \\\\in 2\\\\pi \\\\mathbb Z</math> holds for all weight vectors. To get the set of vectors <math>\\\\boldsymbol m</math> that satisfy this condition, one must consider [[root system|roots]] <math>\\\\boldsymbol \\\\alpha</math> which are [[adjoint representation]] weight vectors. Co-roots, defined using roots by <math>\\\\boldsymbol \\\\alpha^\\\\vee = 2\\\\boldsymbol \\\\alpha/\\\\boldsymbol \\\\alpha^2</math>, span the co-root lattice <math>\\\\Lambda_{\\\\text{co-root}}(\\\\mathfrak g)</math>. These vectors have the useful property that <math>\\\\boldsymbol \\\\alpha^\\\\vee \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mu \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z</math> meaning that the only magnetic charges allowed for the 't Hooft lines are ones that are in the co-root lattice\\n\\n:<math>\\n\\\\boldsymbol m \\\\in 2\\\\pi \\\\Lambda_{\\\\text{co-root}}(\\\\mathfrak g).\\n</math>\\n\\nThis is sometimes written in terms of the [[Langlands dual group|Langlands dual algebra]] <math>\\\\mathfrak g^\\\\vee</math> of <math>\\\\mathfrak g</math> with a weight lattice <math>\\\\Lambda_{mw}</math>, in which case the 't Hooft lines are described by <math>\\\\Lambda_{mw}/W</math>.\\n\\nMore general classes of [[dyon|dyonic]] line operators, with both electric and magnetic charges, can also be constructed. Sometimes called Wilson–'t Hooft line operators, they are defined by pairs of charges <math>(\\\\lambda_e, \\\\lambda_m) \\\\in \\\\Lambda_w \\\\times \\\\Lambda_{mw}</math> up to the [[equivalence class|identification]] that for all <math>w \\\\in W</math> it holds that\\n\\n:<math>\\n(\\\\lambda_e, \\\\lambda_m) \\\\sim (w\\\\lambda_e, w \\\\lambda_m).\\n</math>\\n\\nLine operators play a role in indicating differences in gauge theories of the form <math>G = \\\\tilde G/H</math> that differ by the center subgroup <math>H</math>. Unless they are [[compactification (physics)|compactified]], these theories do not differ in local physics and no amount of local [[experiment|experiments]] can deduce the exact gauge group of the theory. Despite this, the theories do differ in their global properties, such as having different sets of allowed line operators. For example, in <math>\\\\text{SU}(N)</math> gauge theories, Wilson loops are labelled by <math>\\\\Lambda_w(\\\\mathfrak g)</math> while 't Hooft lines by <math>\\\\Lambda_{\\\\text{co-root}}(\\\\mathfrak g)</math>. However in <math>\\\\text{SU}(N)/\\\\mathbb Z_N</math> the lattices are reversed where now the Wilson lines are determined by <math>\\\\Lambda_{\\\\text{co-root}}</math> while the 't Hooft lines are determined by <math>\\\\Lambda_w</math>.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kapustin|first1=A.|authorlink1=Anton Kapustin|date=2006|title=Wilson-'t Hooft operators in four-dimensional gauge theories and S-duality|url=|journal=Phys.
