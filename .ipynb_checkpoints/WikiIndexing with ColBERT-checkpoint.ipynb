Bochner&#x27;s theorem mainBochner&#x27;s theorem Positive-definiteness arises naturally in the theory of the Fourier transform; it can be seen directly that to be positive-definite it is sufficient for f to be the Fourier transform of a function g on the real line with g(y) ≥ 0. The converse result is Bochner&#x27;s theorem, stating that any continuous function positive-definite function on the real line is the Fourier transform of a (positive) measure (mathematics). Applications In statistics, and especially Bayesian statistics, the theorem is usually applied to real functions. Typically, n scalar measurements of some scalar value at points in Rd are taken and points that are mutually close are required to have measurements that are highly correlated. In practice, one must be careful to ensure that the resulting covariance matrix (an nowrapn×n matrix) is always positive-definite. One strategy is to define a correlation matrix A which is then multiplied by a scalar to give a covariance matrix: this must be positive-definite. Bochner&#x27;s theorem states that if the correlation between two points is dependent only upon the distance between them (via function f), then function f must be positive-definite to ensure the covariance matrix A is positive-definite. See Kriging. In this context, Fourier terminology is not normally used and instead it is stated that f(x) is the characteristic function (probability theory) of a symmetric probability density function.

In 1932, John Hasbrouck van Vleck formalized and expanded upon Bohr&#x27;s initial theorem in a book he wrote on electric and magnetic susceptibilities. The significance of this discovery is that classical physics does not allow for such things as paramagnetism, diamagnetism and ferromagnetism and thus quantum physics are needed to explain the magnetic events. This result, &quot;perhaps the most deflationary publication of all time,&quot; may have contributed to Bohr&#x27;s development of a quasi-classical Bohr model in 1913.&quot;</td><td>&quot;In statistics, Bochner&#x27;s theorem can be used to describe the serial correlation of certain type of time series. A sequence of random variables f_n of mean 0 is a (wide-sense) stationary stochastic process if the covariance operatornameCov(f_n, f_m) only depends on n−m. The function g(n - m) = operatornameCov(f_n, f_m) is called the autocovariance function of the time series. By the mean zero assumption, g(n - m) = langle f_n, f_m rangle, where ⟨⋅, ⋅⟩ denotes the inner product on the Hilbert space of random variables with finite second moments. It is then immediate that g is a positive-definite function on the integers mathbbZ. By Bochner&#x27;s theorem, there exists a unique positive measure μ on [0,1] such that g(k) = int e-2 pi i k x ,dmu(x). This measure μ is called the spectral measure of the time series. It yields information about the &quot;seasonal trends&quot; of the series. For example, let z be an m-th root of unity (with the current identification, this is 1/m ∈ [0,1]) and f be a random variable of mean 0 and variance 1. Consider the time series zn f. The autocovariance function is g(k) = zk. Evidently, the corresponding spectral measure is the Dirac measure centered at z. This is related to the fact that the time series repeats itself every m periods. When g has sufficiently fast decay, the measure μ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, and its Radon–Nikodym derivative f is called the spectral density of the time series. When g lies in ell1(mathbbZ), f is the Fourier transform of g.&quot;</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;What does Bochner&#x27;s theorem in mathematics characterize?&quot;</td><td>&quot;Bochner&#x27;s theorem in the special case of the discrete group Z is often referred to as Herglotz&#x27;s theorem (see Herglotz representation theorem) and says that a function f on Z with f(0) = 1 is positive-definite if and only if there exists a probability measure μ on the circle T such that f(k) = int_mathbbT e-2 pi i k x ,dmu(x).

Conversely, the Fourier transform of a probability measure on widehatG is necessarily a normalized continuous positive-definite function f on G. This is in fact a one-to-one correspondence. The Fourier transform#Gelfand transform is an isomorphism between the group C*-algebra C*(G) and C0(G). The theorem is essentially the dual statement for state (functional analysis) of the two abelian C*-algebras. The proof of the theorem passes through vector states on strong operator topology unitary representations of G (the proof in fact shows that every normalized continuous positive-definite function must be of this form). Given a normalized continuous positive-definite function f on G, one can construct a strongly continuous unitary representation of G in a natural way: Let F0(G) be the family of complex-valued functions on G with finite support, i.e. h(g) = 0 for all but finitely many g. The positive-definite kernel K(g1, g2) = f(g1 − g2) induces a (possibly degenerate) inner product on F0(G). Quotiening out degeneracy and taking the completion gives a Hilbert space (mathcalH, langle cdot, cdotrangle_f), whose typical element is an equivalence class [h]. For a fixed g in G, the &quot;shift operator&quot; Ug defined by (Ug)(h) (g&#x27;) = h(g&#x27; − g), for a representative of [h], is unitary. So the map g mapsto U_g is a unitary representations of G on (mathcalH, langle cdot, cdotrangle_f). By continuity of f, it is weakly continuous, therefore strongly continuous.

But Gödel proved that the principles P could not even prove P to be consistent, let alone S. Intuitionism MainIntuitionismConstructivism (mathematics) Intuitionists, such as L. E. J. Brouwer (1882–1966), hold that mathematics is a creation of the human mind. Numbers, like fairy tale characters, are merely mental entities, which would not exist if there were never any human minds to think about them. The foundational philosophy of intuitionism or constructivism (mathematics), as exemplified in the extreme by Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer and Stephen Kleene, requires proofs to be &quot;constructive&quot; in naturesnd the existence of an object must be demonstrated rather than inferred from a demonstration of the impossibility of its non-existence. For example, as a consequence of this the form of proof known as reductio ad absurdum is suspect. Some modern theory in the philosophy of mathematics deny the existence of foundations in the original sense. Some theories tend to focus on mathematical practice, and aim to describe and analyze the actual working of mathematicians as a social group. Others try to create a cognitive science of mathematics, focusing on human cognition as the origin of the reliability of mathematics when applied to the real world. These theories would propose to find foundations only in human thought, not in any objective outside construct. The matter remains controversial.

The proof of the diagonal lemma is likewise surprisingly simple; for example, it does not invoke recursion#Functional recursions in any way. The proof does assume that every L-formula has a Gödel number, but the specifics of a coding method are not required. Hence Tarski&#x27;s theorem is much easier to motivate and prove than the more celebrated Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems about the metamathematical properties of first-order arithmetic. Raymond Smullyan (1991, 2001) has argued forcefully that Tarski&#x27;s undefinability theorem deserves much of the attention garnered by Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems. That the latter theorems have much to say about all of mathematics and more controversially, about a range of philosophical issues (e.g., John Lucas (philosopher) 1961) is less than evident. Tarski&#x27;s theorem, on the other hand, is not directly about mathematics but about the inherent limitations of any formal language sufficiently expressive to be of real interest. Such languages are necessarily capable of enough self-reference for the diagonal lemma to apply to them. The broader philosophical import of Tarski&#x27;s theorem is more strikingly evident. An interpreted language is strongly-semantically-self-representational exactly when the language contains Predicate (grammar) and function symbols defining all the semantic concepts specific to the language. Hence the required functions include the &quot;semantic valuation function&quot; mapping a formula A to its truth value ||A||, and the &quot;semantic denotation function&quot; mapping a term t to the object it denotes. Tarski&#x27;s theorem then generalizes as follows: No sufficiently powerful language is strongly-semantically-self-representational.

Many mathematical objects, such as countable set ring (mathematics), group (mathematics), and field (mathematics), as well as points in effective Polish spaces, can be represented as sets of natural numbers, and modulo this representation can be studied in second-order arithmetic. Reverse mathematics makes use of several subsystems of second-order arithmetic. A typical reverse mathematics theorem shows that a particular mathematical theorem T is equivalent to a particular subsystem S of second-order arithmetic over a weaker subsystem B. This weaker system B is known as the base system for the result; in order for the reverse mathematics result to have meaning, this system must not itself be able to prove the mathematical theorem T. harvtxtSimpson2009 describes five particular subsystems of second-order arithmetic, which he calls the Big Five, that occur frequently in reverse mathematics. In order of increasing strength, these systems are named by the initialisms RCA0, WKL0, ACA0, ATR0, and Πsup1b1-CA0. The following table summarizes the &quot;big five&quot; systemssfnpSimpson2009locp.42 and lists the counterpart systems in higher-order arithmetic.

The field was founded by Harvey Friedman. Its defining method can be described as &quot;going backwards from the theorems to the axioms&quot;, in contrast to the ordinary mathematical practice of deriving theorems from axioms. The reverse mathematics program was foreshadowed by results in set theory such as the classical theorem that the axiom of choice and Zorn&#x27;s lemma are equivalent over ZF set theory. The goal of reverse mathematics, however, is to study possible axioms of ordinary theorems of mathematics rather than possible axioms for set theory. In reverse mathematics, one starts with a framework language and a base theory—a core axiom system—that is too weak to prove most of the theorems one might be interested in, but still powerful enough to develop the definitions necessary to state these theorems. For example, to study the theorem &quot;Every bounded sequence of real numbers has a supremum&quot; it is necessary to use a base system that can speak of real numbers and sequences of real numbers. For each theorem that can be stated in the base system but is not provable in the base system, the goal is to determine the particular axiom system (stronger than the base system) that is necessary to prove that theorem. To show that a system S is required to prove a theorem T, two proofs are required. The first proof shows T is provable from S; this is an ordinary mathematical proof along with a justification that it can be carried out in the system S. The second proof, known as a reversal, shows that T itself implies S; this proof is carried out in the base system. The reversal establishes that no axiom system S that extends the base system can be weaker than S while still provingT.

A fundamental fact, which can be proved by mathematical induction, is that no bijection can exist between {1, 2,..., n} and {1, 2,..., m} unless nowrap1n = m; this fact (together with the fact that two bijections can be function composition to give another bijection) ensures that counting the same set in different ways can never result in different numbers (unless an error is made). This is the fundamental mathematical theorem that gives counting its purpose; however you count a (finite) set, the answer is the same. In a broader context, the theorem is an example of a theorem in the mathematical field of (finite) combinatorics—hence (finite) combinatorics is sometimes referred to as &quot;the mathematics of counting.&quot; Many sets that arise in mathematics do not allow a bijection to be established with {1, 2,..., n} for any natural number n; these are called infinite sets, while those sets for which such a bijection does exist (for some n) are called finite sets. Infinite sets cannot be counted in the usual sense; for one thing, the mathematical theorems which underlie this usual sense for finite sets are false for infinite sets. Furthermore, different definitions of the concepts in terms of which these theorems are stated, while equivalent for finite sets, are inequivalent in the context of infinite sets. The notion of counting may be extended to them in the sense of establishing (the existence of) a bijection with some well-understood set. For instance, if a set can be brought into bijection with the set of all natural numbers, then it is called &quot;countably infinite.&quot; This kind of counting differs in a fundamental way from counting of finite sets, in that adding new elements to a set does not necessarily increase its size, beca…</td><td>&quot;mainPositive-definite function on a group One can define positive-definite functions on any locally compact abelian topological group; Bochner&#x27;s theorem extends to this context.

The product of a finite number of characteristic functions is also a characteristic function. The same holds for an infinite product provided that it converges to a function continuous at the origin. If φ is a characteristic function and α is a real number, then barvarphi, Re(φ), |φ|2, and φ(αt) are also characteristic functions. It is well known that any non-decreasing càdlàg function F with limits F(−∞) = 0, F(+∞) = 1 corresponds to a cumulative distribution function of some random variable. There is also interest in finding similar simple criteria for when a given function φ could be the characteristic function of some random variable. The central result here is Bochner&#x27;s theorem, although its usefulness is limited because the main condition of the theorem, positive-definite function, is very hard to verify. Other theorems also exist, such as Khinchine’s, Mathias’s, or Cramér’s, although their application is just as difficult. George Pólya’s theorem, on the other hand, provides a very simple convexity condition which is sufficient but not necessary. Characteristic functions which satisfy this condition are called Pólya-type.sfnpLukacs1970p84 Bochner&#x27;s theorem. An arbitrary function φ : Rn → C is the characteristic function of some random variable if and only if φ is positive-definite function, continuous at the origin, and if φ(0) = 1.

Typically, n scalar measurements of some scalar value at points in Rd are taken and points that are mutually close are required to have measurements that are highly correlated. In practice, one must be careful to ensure that the resulting covariance matrix (an nowrapn×n matrix) is always positive-definite. One strategy is to define a correlation matrix A which is then multiplied by a scalar to give a covariance matrix: this must be positive-definite. Bochner&#x27;s theorem states that if the correlation between two points is dependent only upon the distance between them (via function f), then function f must be positive-definite to ensure the covariance matrix A is positive-definite. See Kriging. In this context, Fourier terminology is not normally used and instead it is stated that f(x) is the characteristic function (probability theory) of a symmetric probability density function.&quot;</td><td>&quot;Riemannian manifold has positive Ricci curvature then its fundamental group is finite.

The set of all Riemannian manifolds with positive Ricci curvature and diameter at most D is Metric space in the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence.&quot;</td><td>&quot;Bochner spaces are often used in the functional analysis approach to the study of partial differential equations that depend on time, e.g. the heat equation: if the temperature g(t, x) is a scalar function of time and space, one can write (f(t))(x) := g(t,x) to make f a family f(t) (parametrized by time) of functions of space, possibly in some Bochner space. Application to PDE theory Very often, the space T is an Interval (mathematics) of time over which we wish to solve some partial differential equation, and mu will be one-dimensional Lebesgue measure. The idea is to regard a function of time and space as a collection of functions of space, this collection being parametrized by time. For example, in the solution of the heat equation on a region Omega in Rn and an interval of time [0, T], one seeks solutions with time derivative Here H_01(Omega) denotes the Sobolev space Hilbert space of once-weak derivative functions with first weak derivative in L2(Omega) that vanish at the Boundary (topology) of Ω (in the sense of trace, or, equivalently, are limits of smooth functions with Compact space Support (mathematics) in Ω); H-1 (Omega) denotes the dual space of H_01(Omega). (The &quot;partial derivative&quot; with respect to time t above is actually a total derivative, since the use of Bochner spaces removes the space-dependence.)&quot;</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;What does Bochner&#x27;s theorem in mathematics characterize?&quot;</td><td>&quot;Merely the use of formalism alone does not explain several issues: why we should use the axioms we do and not some others, why we should employ the logical rules we do and not some others, why do &quot;true&quot; mathematical statements (e.g., the Peano axioms) appear to be true, and so on. Hermann Weyl would ask these very questions of Hilbert: blockquoteWhat &quot;truth&quot; or objectivity can be ascribed to this theoretic construction of the world, which presses far beyond the given, is a profound philosophical problem. It is closely connected with the further question: what impels us to take as a basis precisely the particular axiom system developed by Hilbert? Consistency is indeed a necessary but not a sufficient condition. For the time being we probably cannot answer this question ... In some cases these questions may be sufficiently answered through the study of formal theories, in disciplines such as reverse mathematics and computational complexity theory. As noted by Weyl, formal logical systems also run the risk of consistency proof; in Peano axioms, this arguably has already been settled with several proofs of consistency proof, but there is debate over whether or not they are sufficiently finitism to be meaningful. Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem establishes that logical systems of arithmetic can never contain a valid proof of their own consistency proof. What Hilbert wanted to do was prove a logical system S was consistent, based on principles P that only made up a small part of S. But Gödel proved that the principles P could not even prove P to be consistent, let alone S. Intuitionism MainIntuitionismConstructivism (mathematics) Intuitionists, such as L. E. J. Brouwer (1882–1966), hold that mathematics is a creation of the human mind. Numbers, like fairy tale characters, are merely mental entities, which would not exist if there were never any human minds to think about them.

By an alternative formulation of the same approach, Siu was able to prove a variant of the still-unsolved Hodge conjecture, albeit in the restricted context of negative curvature. Kevin Corlette found a significant extension of Siu&#x27;s Bochner formula, and used it to prove new superrigidity for lattices in certain Lie groups.sfnm1a1Corlette1y1992 Following this, Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov and Richard Schoen extended much of the theory of harmonic maps to allow (N, h) to be replaced by a metric space.sfnm1a1Gromov1a2Schoen1y1992 By an extension of the Eells−Sampson theorem together with an extension of the Siu–Corlette Bochner formula, they were able to prove new rigidity theorems for lattices.&quot;</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;What does Bochner&#x27;s theorem in mathematics characterize?&quot;</td><td>&quot;Small rafts can sometimes be stabilized to form larger platforms through protein-protein interactions&quot; In recent years, lipid raft studies have tried to address many of the key issues that cause controversy in this field, including the size and lifetime of rafts.

The top of the pressure vessel is 17ft (5.2m) below the pool surface. The control plate drive mechanisms are in a sub-pile room beneath the pressure vessel. These features give the necessary shielding for working above the reactor core and greatly facilitate access to the pressure vessel, core, and reflector regions. The reactor core is cylindrical, about 2ft (0.61m) high and convert15inmm in diameter. A 5-in. (12.70-cm)-diameter hole, the &quot;flux trap,&quot; forms the center of the core. The target is typically loaded with curium-244 and other transplutonic isotopes and is positioned on the reactor vertical axis within the flux trap. The fuel region is made of two concentric fuel elements. The inner element contains 171 fuel plates; the outer element has 369. The fuel plates are curved in the shape of an involute, hence constant coolant channel width. The fuel (93% 235U enriched U3O8-Al cermet pg.22) is non-uniformly distributed along the arc of the involute to minimize the radial peak-to-average power density ratio. A burnable poison (boron-10) is included in the inner fuel element primarily to flatten the radial flux peak providing a longer cycle for each fuel element. Average core lifetime with typical experiment loading is ~23 days at 85 MW. The fuel region is surrounded by a concentric ring of beryllium reflector ~1ft (0.3m) thick. This in turn is subdivided into three regions: the removable reflector, the semi-permanent reflector, and the permanent reflector. The beryllium is surrounded by a water reflector of effectively infinite thickness. In the axial direction, the reactor is reflected by water.

All actinides can undergo neutron induced fission with unmoderated or fast neutrons. A fast reactor is therefore more efficient than a thermal reactor for using plutonium and higher actinides as fuel. These fast reactors are better suited for the Nuclear transmutation of other actinides than thermal reactors. Because thermal reactors use slow or moderated neutrons, the actinides that are not fissionable with thermal neutrons tend to absorb the neutrons instead of fissioning. This leads to buildup of heavier actinides and lowers the number of thermal neutrons available to continue the chain reaction. A subcritical reactor with an external neutron source could either be run in the fast neutron spectrum (without the need for highly enriched fuels as otherwise common in fast reactors) or use thermal neutrons to breed fissile materials, compensating the loss of neutrons by increasing the flux from the neutron source.&quot;</td><td>true</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>48</td><td>&quot;What is the significance of the high neutron flux in the High Flux Isotope Reactor?&quot;</td><td>&quot;High Flux Isotope Reactor&quot;</td><td>&quot;HB-1 and HB-3&quot;</td><td>32900</td><td>10</td><td>24214</td><td>&quot;High Flux Isotope Reactor&quot;</td><td>&quot;In-Core Experiment Facilities&quot;</td><td>&quot;File:High Flux Isotope Reactor Core Cross Section.jpg Flux Trap Positions Target Positions Thirty-one target positions are provided in the flux trap. These positions were originally designed to be occupied by target rods used for the production of transplutonium elements; however, other experiments can be irradiated in any of these positions. A similar target capsule configuration can be used in many applications. A third type of target is designed to house up to nine 2-inch-long isotope or materials irradiation capsules that are similar to the rabbit facility capsules. The use of this type of irradiation capsule simplifies fabrication, shipping, and post-irradiation processing which translates to a cost savings for the experimenter. Target irradiation capsules of each type must be designed so that they can be adequately cooled by the coolant flow available outside the target-rod shrouds. Excessive neutron poison loads in experiments in target positions are discouraged because of their adverse effects on both transplutonic isotope production rates and fuel cycle length. Such experiments require careful coordination to ensure minimal effects on adjacent experiments, fuel cycle length, and neutron scattering beam brightness. Two positions are now available for instrumented target experiments: positions E3 and E6. Peripheral Target Positions Six peripheral target positions (PTPs) are provided for experiments, at the outer radial edge of the flux trap. Fast-neutron fluxes in these positions are the highest available to experiments in the reactor, though a steep radial gradient in the thermal-neutron flux exists at this location.

The history of such philosophical theories that relate to chemistry can probably be traced back to every single ancient civilization. The common aspect in all these theories was the attempt to identify a small number of primary classical elements that make up all the various substances in nature.

In Asharite atomism, atoms are the only perpetual, material things in existence, and all else in the world is &quot;accidental&quot; meaning something that lasts for only an instant. Nothing accidental can be the cause of anything else, except perception, as it exists for a moment. Contingent events are not subject to natural physical causes, but are the direct result of God&#x27;s constant intervention, without which nothing could happen. Thus nature is completely dependent on God, which meshes with other Asharite Islamic ideas on causation, or the lack thereof (Gardet 2001). Al-Ghazali also used the theory to support his theory of occasionalism. In a sense, the Asharite theory of atomism has far more in common with Indian atomism than it does with Greek atomism. Other traditions in Islam rejected the atomism of the Asharites and expounded on many Greek texts, especially those of Aristotle. An active school of philosophers in Al-Andalus, including the noted commentator Averroes (11261198 CE) explicitly rejected the thought of al-Ghazali and turned to an extensive evaluation of the thought of Aristotle. Averroes commented in detail on most of the works of Aristotle and his commentaries became Averroism in Jewish and Christian scholastic thought.

The ancient Indian philosophy including Vedic philosophy believed that Classical element are the basis of all cosmic creations. In the western philosophy tradition, after much debate about the primal element among earlier pre-Socratic philosophys, Empedocles proposed a four-element theory, in which all substances derive from earth (classical element), water (classical element), air (classical element), and fire (classical element). The Empedoclean element of fire is perhaps the principal ancestor of later concepts such as phlogiston and caloric theory. Around 500 BC, the Greek philosophy Heraclitus became famous as the &quot;flux and fire&quot; philosopher for his proverbial utterance: &quot;All things are flowing.&quot; Heraclitus argued that the three classical elements in nature were fire, earth, and water. Vacuum-abhorrence The 5th century BC Greek philosopher Parmenides, in his only known work, a poem conventionally titled On Nature, uses verbal reasoning to postulate that a void, essentially what is now known as a vacuum, in nature could not occur. This view was supported by the arguments of Aristotle, but was criticized by Leucippus and Hero of Alexandria. From antiquity to the Middle Ages various arguments were put forward to prove or disapprove the existence of a vacuum and several attempts were made to construct a vacuum but all proved unsuccessful.File:Thermally Agitated Molecule.gif Atomism Atomism is a central part of today&#x27;s relationship between thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.

Thales also made advancements in 580 BCE by suggesting that water is Arche, experimenting with the attraction between magnets and rubbed amber and formulating the first recorded Cosmology. Anaximander, famous for his proto-evolutionary theory, disputed Thales&#x27; ideas and proposed that rather than water, a substance called Apeiron (cosmology) was the building block of all matter. Around 500 BCE, Heraclitus proposed that the only basic law governing the Universe was the principle of change and that nothing remains in the same state indefinitely. This observation made him one of the first scholars in ancient physics to address the role of time in the universe, a key and sometimes contentious concept in modern and present-day physics. File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg During the Classical Greece in Greece (6th, 5th and 4th centuries BCE) and in Hellenistic civilization, natural philosophy slowly developed into an exciting and contentious field of study.

The natural philosophy of atomism appeared in several ancient traditions. In ancient Greek philosophy, the Pre-Socratic philosophy speculated that the apparent diversity of observed phenomena was due to a single type of interaction, namely the motions and collisions of atoms. The concept of &#x27;atom&#x27; proposed by Democritus was an early philosophical attempt to unify phenomena observed in nature. The concept of &#x27;atom&#x27; also appeared in the Nyaya-Vaisheshika school of ancient Indian philosophy. Archimedes was possibly the first philosopher to have described nature with axioms (or principles) and then deduce new results from them. Any &quot;theory of everything&quot; is similarly expected to be based on axioms and to deduce all observable phenomena from them.rp340 Following earlier atomistic thought, the mechanical philosophy of the 17th century posited that all forces could be ultimately reduced to contact forces between the atoms, then imagined as tiny solid particles.rp184 In the late 17th century, Isaac Newton&#x27;s description of the long-distance force of gravity implied that not all forces in nature result from things coming into contact.…</td><td>92504</td><td>67299</td><td>&quot;History of chemistry&quot;</td><td>&quot;Ancient history&quot;</td><td>&quot;found in a wide variety of past cultures and civilizations.

In medieval universities there were expressions of atomism. For example, in the 14th century Nicholas of Autrecourt considered that matter, space, and time were all made up of indivisible atoms, points, and instants and that all generation and corruption took place by the rearrangement of material atoms. The similarities of his ideas with those of al-Ghazali suggest that Nicholas may have been familiar with Ghazali&#x27;s work, perhaps through Averroes&#x27; refutation of it (Marmara, 197374). Although the atomism of Epicurus had fallen out of favor in the centuries of Scholasticism, the minima naturalia of Aristotelianism received extensive consideration.

It is difficult to determine which contributions to atomism come from Democritus and which come from Leucippus. Aristotle and his student Theophrastus explicitly credit Leucippus with the invention of atomism. In Aristotelian terms, Leucippus agreed with the Eleatic argument that &quot;true being does not admit of vacuum&quot; and there can be no movement in the absence of vacuum. Leucippus contended that since movement exists, there must be empty space. However, he concludes that vacuum is identified with nonbeing, since &quot;nothing&quot; cannot really be. According to Aristotle, Leucippus differed from the Eleatics in not being encumbered by the &quot;conceptual intermingling&quot; of being and non-being, and Plato made the necessary distinction between &quot;grades of being and types of negation&quot;.

The natural philosophy of atomism appeared in several ancient traditions. In ancient Greek philosophy, the Pre-Socratic philosophy speculated that the apparent diversity of observed phenomena was due to a single type of interaction, namely the motions and collisions of atoms. The concept of &#x27;atom&#x27; proposed by Democritus was an early philosophical attempt to unify phenomena observed in nature. The concept of &#x27;atom&#x27; also appeared in the Nyaya-Vaisheshika school of ancient Indian philosophy. Archimedes was possibly the first philosopher to have described nature with axioms (or principles) and then deduce new results from them. Any &quot;theory of everything&quot; is similarly expected to be based on axioms and to deduce all observable phenomena from them.rp340 Following earlier atomistic thought, the mechanical philosophy of the 17th century posited that all forces could be ultimately reduced to contact forces between the atoms, then imagined as tiny solid particles.rp184 In the late 17th century, Isaac Newton&#x27;s description of the long-distance force of gravity implied that not all forces in nature result from t…</td><td>157247</td><td>115456</td><td>&quot;Atomic theory&quot;</td><td>&quot;Philosophical atomism&quot;</td><td>&quot;mainAtomism see alsoPrima materia The idea that matter is made up of discrete units is a very old idea, appearing in many ancient cultures, including Greece and India. The word &quot;atom&quot; (lang-grc-gre:wikt:ἄτομος; langgrc-Latnatomos), meaning &quot;uncuttable&quot;, was coined by the Pre-Socratic philosophy Leucippus and his pupil Democritus (circa460–circa370 BC). Democritus taught that atoms were infinite in number, uncreated, and eternal, and that the qualities of an object result from the kind of atoms that compose it. Democritus&#x27;s atomism was refined and elaborated by the later Greek philosopher Epicurus (341–270 BC), and by the Roman Epicurean poet Lucretius (circa99–circa55 BC). During the Early Middle Ages, atomism was mostly forgotten in western Europe. During the 12th century, it became known again in western Europe through references to it in the newly-rediscovered writings of Aristotle. The opposing view of matter upheld by Aristotle was that matter was continuous and infinite and could be subdivided without limit. In the 14th century, the rediscovery of major ancient works describing atomist teachings, including Lucretius&#x27;s De rerum natura and Diogenes Laërtius&#x27;s Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, led to increased scholarly attention on the subject. Nonetheless, because atomism was associated with the philosophy of Epicureanism, which contradicted orthodox Christian teachings, belief in atoms was not considered acceptable by most European philosophers. The French Catholic priest Pierre Gassendi (1592–1655) revived Epicurean atomism with modifications, arguing that atoms were created by God and, though extremely numerous, are not infinite in number. He was the first person who used the term &quot;molecule&quot; to describe aggregation of atoms. Gassendi&#x27;s modified theory of atoms was popularized in France by the physician François Bernier (1620–1688) and in England by the natural philosopher Walter Charleton (1619–1707).
