       "It is believedBy whomdateMay 2023 that the BBSome assembles sequentially, beginning with the association of BBS7, BBS chaperonins, and the CCT/TRiC complex, which functions as a scaffold to which further subunits can bind. BBS2 and BBS7 bind together first. BBS2 and BBS7 are missing in certain species, such as Drosophila, which leads to the idea that they might be more important in organizing the BBSome in higher organisms rather than directly related to the cargo and membrane binding functions of the BBSome. Then, BBS9 is added to the core complex followed by BBS5 and BBS8.\n",

       " Core structure \n",
       "\n",
       "BBIP1, also known as BBS18, is the smallest subunit that is located in the center of the complex. This protein domain winds through two super-helically arranged (TPR) domains of the BBS4 and BBS8 subunits, which are arranged perpendicularly and stabilized by ionic interactions. Together, the BBS18 domain clamps the other two subunits in a Y-shaped layout that serves as the backbone for the BBSome complex. It is critical for the stability and assembly of the BBSome, particularly with stabilizing the interactions between BBS4 and BBS8. BBS8 has a loop in its domain that is different across purified BBSomes which leads to the idea that this domain might be involved in tissue specific activity of the BBSome. The C-terminal helix of BBS18 also loosely interacts with the gamma-adaptin ear (GAE) domain of BBS1, the most relevant domain to cargo recognition, to also aid with structure of the complex. BBS1 then binds its N-terminal β-propeller domain to the N-terminal of the BBS4 TPR superhelix, a connection which is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. It wraps around the BBS4 and BBS8 domains and binds its C-terminal GAE domain to the TPR domain of BBS8. BBS9 associates in a similar but reciprocal manner with its N-terminal β-propeller domain bound to the N-terminus of the TPR superhelix of BBS8. BBS9 then wraps around BBS4 and parts of BBS1 and binds its C-terminal GAE…</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;Dried fruit\n",

He takes a physiological approach to multiple intelligence by breaking it into eight categories. These categories help teachers understand the different types of diverse learning abilities. First is logical/mathematical which means the student learns better with logic, reasoning and numbers. Verbal/ Linguistic is another way that the students&#x27; strengths are with words and language.

       "It is believed that the extinction, which coincided with the beginning of a major negative δ13C excursion signifying a severe disturbance of the carbon cycle, was triggered by eruptions of the Emeishan Traps large igneous province, basalt piles from which currently cover an area of 250,000 to 500,000km2, although the original volume of the basalts may have been anywhere from 500,000km3 to over 1,000,000km3. The age of the extinction event and the deposition of the Emeishan basalts are in good alignment. Reefs and other marine sediments interbedded among basalt piles indicate Emeishan volcanism initially developed underwater; terrestrial outflows of lava occurred only later in the large igneous province&#x27;s period of activity. These eruptions would have released high doses of toxic mercury (element); increased mercury concentrations are coincident with the negative carbon isotope excursion, indicating a common volcanic cause. Coronene enrichment at the Guadalupian-Lopingian boundary further confirms the existence of massive volcanic activity; coronene can only form at extremely high temperatures created either by extraterrestrial impacts or massive volcanism, with the former being ruled out because of an absence of iridium anomalies coeval with mercury and coronene anomalies. A large amount of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide is believed to have been discharged into the stratosphere of the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemispheres due to the equatorial location of the Emeishan Traps, leading to sudden global cooling and nowraplong-term global warming. The Emeishan Traps discharged between 130 and 188 teratonnes of carbon dioxide in total, doing so at a rate of between 0.08 to 0.25 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide per year, making them responsible for an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide that was both one of the largest and one of the most precipitous in the entire geological history of the Earth.

The abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women per year, though it was 24 per 1000 women per year for developed countries and 29 per 1000 women per year for developing countries.

This has been illustrated by calculations of the magnetically induced currents, which sum up to 29 nA/T, much more than in the archetypical Aromaticity molecule benzene (11 nA/T).\n",

       "Radioactive decay results in a reduction of summed rest mass, once the released energy (the disintegration energy) has escaped in some way. Although decay energy is sometimes defined as associated with the difference between the mass of the parent nuclide products and the mass of the decay products, this is true only of rest mass measurements, where some energy has been removed from the product system. This is true because the decay energy must always carry mass with it, wherever it appears (see mass in special relativity) according to the formula E=mc2. The decay energy is initially released as the energy of emitted photons plus the kinetic energy of massive emitted particles (that is, particles that have rest mass). If these particles come to thermal equilibrium with their surroundings and photons are absorbed, then the decay energy is transformed to thermal energy, which retains its mass.\n",
       "\n",
       "Decay energy, therefore, remains associated with a certain measure of the mass of the decay system, called invariant mass, which does not change during the decay, even though the energy of decay is distributed among decay particles. The energy of photons, the kinetic energy of emitted particles, and, later, the thermal energy of the surrounding matter, all contribute to the invariant mass of the system. Thus, while the sum of the rest masses of the particles is not conserved in radioactive decay, the system mass and system invariant mass (and also the system total energy) is conserved throughout any decay process.

Learning style theory suggests that learning styles differ from student to student. A few examples of learning styles are active learners, verbal learners, and reflective learners. Learning styles#Criticism is highly criticized and lacks empirical evidence to support it. Another type of modality is multiple intelligence, which was created by Howard Gardner. He takes a physiological approach to multiple intelligence by breaking it into eight categories. These categories help teachers understand the different types of diverse learning abilities. First is logical/mathematical which means the student learns better with logic, reasoning and numbers. Verbal/ Linguistic is another way that the students' strengths are with words and language. Another type is visual/spatial in which a student would rather use graphs, charts and drawings. Students who enjoy sound, rhymes, and music are musical/rhythmical learners. Bodily/kinesthetic learners are better with their hands and have better control over their bodily motions. Another type is Naturalist/Environmental, these students are sensitive, nurturing and like to use all five sense. The seventh …\n",

       "It is believed that the extinction, which coincided with the beginning of a major negative δ13C excursion signifying a severe disturbance of the carbon cycle, was triggered by eruptions of the Emeishan Traps large igneous province, basalt piles from which currently cover an area of 250,000 to 500,000km2, although the original volume of the basalts may have been anywhere from 500,000km3 to over 1,000,000km3. The age of the extinction event and the deposition of the Emeishan basalts are in good alignment. Reefs and other marine sediments interbedded among basalt piles indicate Emeishan volcanism initially developed underwater; terrestrial outflows of lava occurred only later in the large igneous province's period of activity. These eruptions would have released high doses of toxic mercury (element); increased mercury concentrations are coincident with the negative carbon isotope excursion, indicating a common volcanic cause. Coronene enrichment at the Guadalupian-Lopingian boundary further confirms the existence of massive volcanic activity; coronene can only form at extremely high temperatures created either by extraterrestrial impacts or massive volcanism, with the former being ruled out because of an absence of iridium anomalies coeval with mercury and coronene anomalies. A large amount of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide is believed to have been discharged into the stratosphere of the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemispheres due to the equatorial location of the Emeishan Traps, leading to sudden global cooling and nowraplong-term global warming. The Emeishan Traps discharged between 130 and 188 teratonnes of carbon dioxide in total, doing so at a rate of between 0.08 to 0.25 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide per year, making them responsible for an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide that was both one of the largest and one of the most precipitous in the entire geological history of the Earth.

On May 28, the system eventually developed into a tropical depression which became the first storm in the basin and was designated as One-E by the NHC. Later, the system strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Hurricane Agatha. Agatha furthermore intensified into the basin's first hurricane. Agatha reached its peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane and made landfall near Puerto Angel in Mexico with winds up to 105mph. This made Agatha the strongest hurricane to make landfall during the month of May in the basin.\n",

       "On the first week of June, the NHC first noted a low pressure area that formed off the Gulf of Tehuantepec, and designated the system as Invest 92E. On June 11, the disturbance became more organized and the system was reclassified as Tropical Depression Two-E three days later by the NHC. Later, the depression intensified to a tropical storm and was named Hurricane Blas (2022) which became the second named storm in the Eastern Pacific basin. Blas further intensified into the basin's second hurricane. Blas's structure continued to improve, developing a mid-level eye on the western portions of the cyclone. On June 18, Blas weakened into a tropical storm due to unfavorable conditions causing Blas's structure to deteriorate along with its deep convection. Two days later, Blas transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone and dissipated on June 24. Blas caused four deaths, two in Guerrero and two in Puebla in Mexico. Additionally, six people died in El Salvador due to heavy rain related to Blas's precursor disturbance and other weather systems. No coastal watches or warnings were put into effect for Blas.

       "\t\"There are two commonly used methods of measuring the incidence of abortion:\n",
       " Abortion rate– number of abortions annually per 1,000 women between 15 and 44 years of age; some sources use a range of 15–49.\n",
       " Abortion percentage– number of abortions out of 100 known pregnancies; pregnancies include live births, abortions, and miscarriages.\n",
       "\n",
       "In many places, where abortion is illegal or carries a heavy social stigma, medical reporting of abortion is not reliable. For this reason, estimates of the incidence of abortion must be made without determining certainty related to standard error. The number of abortions performed worldwide seems to have remained stable in the early 2000s, with 41.6million having been performed in 2003 and 43.8million having been performed in 2008. The abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women per year, though it was 24 per 1000 women per year for developed countries and 29 per 1000 women per year for developing countries. The same 2012 study indicated that in 2008, the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide, with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries.\n",
       "\n",
       "On average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. Restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely. The unsafe abortion rate in developing countries is partly attributable to lack of access to modern contraceptives; according to the Guttmacher Institute, providing access to contraceptives would result in about 14.5 million fewer unsafe abortions and 38,000 fewer deaths from unsafe abortion annually worldwide.\n",

       "The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world. Some of the reasons may include an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, and the wish to complete education or advance a career. Additional reasons include not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.\n",
       "\n",
       "Societal\n",
       "Some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures. These might include the preference for children of a specific sex or race, disapproval of single or early motherhood, stigmatization of people with disabilities, insufficient economic support for families, lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods, or efforts toward population control (such as China's one-child policy). These factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or sex-selective abortion.\n",

Under the right of privacy, physicians must be free to use their \"medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\" On the same day that the Court decided Roe, it also decided Doe v.

       "\t\"Main memory\n",
       "Early computers used one of two addressing methods to access the system memory; binary (base 2) or decimal (base 10). For example, the IBM 701 (1952) used binary and could address 2048 Word (data type) of 36 bits each, while the IBM 702 (1953) used decimal and could address ten thousand 7-bit words.\n",
       "\n",
       "By the mid-1960s, binary addressing had become the standard architecture in most computer designs, and main memory sizes were most commonly powers of two. This is the most natural configuration for memory, as all combinations of their address lines map to a valid address, allowing easy aggregation into a larger block of memory with contiguous addresses.  \n",
       "\n",
       "While early documentation specified those memory sizes as exact numbers such as 4096, 8192, or val16384 units (usually word (computer), bytes, or bits), computer professionals also started using the long-established metric system prefixes \"kilo\", \"mega\", \"giga\", etc., defined to be powers of 10, to mean instead the nearest powers of two; namely, 210 = 1024, 220 = 10242, 230 = 10243, etc..  The corresponding metric prefix symbols (\"k\", \"M\", \"G\", etc.) where used with the same binary meanings.  The symbol for 210 = 1024 could be written either in lower case (\"k\") or in uppercase (\"K\").  The latter was often used intentionally to indicate the binary rather than decimal meaning. This convention (which could not be extended to higher powers) was widely used in the documentation of the IBM 360 (1964) and of the IBM System/370 (1972), of the CDC 7600, of the DEC PDP-11/70 (1975) and of the DEC VAX-11/780 (1977). \n",

Salva's electrolyte telegraph system was very innovative though it was greatly influenced by and based upon two discoveries made in Europe in 1800—Alessandro Volta's electric battery for generating an electric current and William Nicholson and Anthony Carlyle's electrolysis of water. Electrical telegraphy may be considered the first example of electrical engineering. Electrical engineering became a profession in the later 19th century.

The chemP4 molecule in the gas phase has a P-P bond length of rg = 2.1994(3) Å as was determined by gas electron diffraction. The nature of bonding in this chemP4 tetrahedron can be described by spherical aromaticity or cluster bonding, that is the electrons are highly Delocalized electron.

       "Radioactive decay results in a reduction of summed rest mass, once the released energy (the disintegration energy) has escaped in some way. Although decay energy is sometimes defined as associated with the difference between the mass of the parent nuclide products and the mass of the decay products, this is true only of rest mass measurements, where some energy has been removed from the product system. This is true because the decay energy must always carry mass with it, wherever it appears (see mass in special relativity) according to the formula E=mc2. The decay energy is initially released as the energy of emitted photons plus the kinetic energy of massive emitted particles (that is, particles that have rest mass). If these particles come to thermal equilibrium with their surroundings and photons are absorbed, then the decay energy is transformed to thermal energy, which retains its mass.\n",
       "\n",
       "Decay energy, therefore, remains associated with a certain measure of the mass of the decay system, called invariant mass, which does not change during the decay, even though the energy of decay is distributed among decay particles. The energy of photons, the kinetic energy of emitted particles, and, later, the thermal energy of the surrounding matter, all contribute to the invariant mass of the system. Thus, while the sum of the rest masses of the particles is not conserved in radioactive decay, the system mass and system invariant mass (and also the system total energy) is conserved throughout any decay process. This is a restatement of the equivalent laws of conservation of energy and conservation of mass.\n",

From satellites, PMCs are most frequently observed above 70–75° in latitude and have a season of 60 to 80 days duration centered about a peak which occurs about 20 days after the summer solstice. This holds true for both hemispheres. Great variability in scattering is observed from day-to-day and year-to- year, but averaging over large time and space scales reveals a basic underlying symmetry and pattern. The long- term behaviour of polar mesospheric cloud frequency has been found to vary inversely with solar activity.\n",

       "PMC's have four major types based on physical structure and appearance. Type I veils are very tenuous and lack well-defined structure, somewhat like cirrostratus or poorly defined cirrus. Type II bands are long streaks that often occur in groups arranged roughly parallel to each other. They are usually more widely spaced than the bands or elements seen with cirrocumulus clouds. Type III billows are arrangements of closely spaced, roughly parallel short streaks that mostly resemble cirrus. Type IV whirls are partial or, more rarely, complete rings of cloud with dark centres.\n",

They may be observed ‘edge-on’ against the comparatively dark sky background, even in full daylight. The photometer field of view must be well baffled to avoid interference from the very bright Earth about a degree beneath the cloud layer. It is a much more difficult task to observe the clouds against the bright background of the illuminated Earth, although this has been achieved in the ultraviolet in the 200 to 300nm spectral region, because of the very small albedo of the earth in this part of spectrum.\n",
